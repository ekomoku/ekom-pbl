In this project we will enhance our Tooling Website solution by adding a Load Balancer to disctribute traffic between Web Servers and allow users to access our website using a single URL.

Task
Deploy and configure an Apache Load Balancer for Tooling Website solution on a separate Ubuntu EC2 intance. Make sure that users can be served by Web servers through the Load Balancer.

To simplify, I'll implement this solution with 2 Web Servers, the approach will be the same for 3 and more Web Servers.
